<body>
Is my lover on the sea
Sailing east or sailing west,
Mighty ocean, gentle be,
Rock him into rest.

Let no angry wind arise
Nor a wave with whitened crest,
All be gentle as his eyes
When he is caressed.

Bear him as the breeze above
Bears the bird unto his nest,
There unto his home of love
And there bid him rest.
