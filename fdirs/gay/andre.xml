    All in the Downs the fleet was moor'd,
       The streamers waving in the wind,
    When black-eye'd Susan came aboard.
       Oh! where shall I my true-love find?
Tell me, ye jovial sailors, tell me true,
If my sweet William sails among the crew.

    William, who high upon the yard
      Rock'd with the billow to and fro,
    Soon as her well-known voice he heard,
      He sigh'd, and cast his eyes below;
The cord slides swiftly through his glowing hands,
And (quick as lightning) on the deck he stands.

     So the sweet lark, high poised in air,
       Shuts close his pinions to his breast,
     (If chance his mate's shrill call he hear,)
       And drops at once into her nest.
The noblest captain in the British fleet
Might envy William's lip those kisses sweet.

     O Susan, Susan, lovely dear,
       My vows shall ever true remain;
     Let me kiss off that falling tear;
       We only part to meet again.
Change, as ye list, ye winds; my heart shall be
The faithful compass that still points to thee.

     Believe not what the landmen say,
       Who tempt with doubts thy constant mind.
     They'll tell thee, sailors, when away,
       In every port a mistress find:
Yes, yes, believe them when they tell thee so,
For thou art present wheresoe'er I go.

     If to fair India's coast we sail,
       Thy eyes are seen in diamonds bright,
     Thy breath is Afric's spicy gale,
       Thy skin is ivory so white.
Thus every beauteous object that I view,
Wakes in my soul some charm of lovely Sue.

     Though battle call me from thy arms,
       Let not my pretty Susan mourn;
     Though cannons roar, yet, safe from harms,
       William shall to his dear return.
Love turns aside the balls that round me fly,
Lest precious tears should drop from Susan's eye.

     The boatswain gave the dreadful word,
        The sails their swelling bosom spread;
     No longer must she stay aboard:
        They kiss'd, she sigh'd, he hung his head.
Her lessening boat unwilling rows to land:
Adieu! she cries; and waved her lily hand.

   <title>A Ballad</title>
   <subtitle>From the What-d'ye-call-it</subtitle>
   <firstline>Twas when the seas were roaring</firstline>
   <quality>korrektur1</quality>
</head>
<body>
'Twas when the seas were roaring
  With hollow blasts of wind;
A damsel lay deploring,
  All on a rock reclined.
Wide o'er the foaming billows
  She casts a wistful look;
Her head was crown'd with willows,
  That trembled o'er the brook.

Twelve months are gone and over,
  And nine long tedious days.
Why didst thou, venturous lover,
  Why didst thou trust the seas?
Cease, cease, thou cruel ocean,
  And let my lover rest:
Ah! what's thy troubled motion
  To that within my breast?

The merchant, robb'd of pleasure,
  Sees tempests in despair:
But what's the loss of treasure,
  To losing of my dear?
Should you some coast be laid on,
  Where gold and diamonds grow,
You'd find a richer maiden,
  But none that loves you so.

How can they say that nature
  Has nothing made in vain;
Why then beneath the water
  Should hideous rocks remain?
No eyes the rocks discover,
  That lurk beneath the deep,
To wreck the wandering lover,
  And leave the maid to weep.

All melancholy lying,
  Thus wail'd she for her dear;
Repaid each blast with sighing,
  Each billow with a tear;
When o'er the white wave stooping,
  His floating corpse she spied;
Then, like a lily drooping,
  She bow'd her head, and died.
