   <title>Where is the Sea?</title>
   <subtitle>Song of the Greek islander in Exile</subtitle>
   <firstline>Where is is the sea? - I languish here -</firstline>

<nonum><wrap>A Greek Islander, being taken to the Vale of Tempe, and called upon to admire its beauty, only replied—“<i>The sea—where is it?</i>”</wrap></nonum>
    
Where is is the sea?—I languish here—
  Where is my own blue sea?
With all its barks in fleet career,
  And flags, and breezes free.
 
I miss that voice of waves, which first 
  Awoke my childhood's glee;
The measured chime—the thundering burst—
  Where is my own blue sea?

Oh! rich your myrtle's breath may rise,
  Soft, soft your winds may be;
Yet my sick heart within me dies— 
  Where is my own blue sea?
  
I hear the shepherd's mountain flute— 
  I hear the whispering tree;—
The echoes of my soul are mute:
  —Where is my own blue sea?
