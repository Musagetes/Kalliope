<body>
I lie in a heavy trance,	
With a world of dream without me	
Shapes of shadow dance,	
In wavering bands about me;	
But, at times, some mystic things	
Appear in this phantom lair,	
That almost seem to me visitings	
Of Truth known elsewhere:	
The world is wide,—these things are small,	
They may be nothing, but they are All.	

A prayer in an hour of pain,	
Begun in an undertone,	
Then lowered, as it would fain	
Be heard by the heart alone;	
A throb, when the soul is entered	
By a light that is lit above,	
Where the God of Nature has centered	
The Beauty of Love.—	
The world is wide,—these things are small,	
They may be nothing, but they are All.	

A look that is telling a tale,	
Which looks alone dare tell,—	
When a cheek is no longer pale,	
That has caught the glance, as it fell;	
A touch, which seems to unlock	
Treasures unknown as yet,	
And the bitter-sweet first shock,	
One can never forget;	
The world is wide,—these things are small,	
They may be nothing, but they are All.	

A sense of an earnest Will	
To help the lowly-living,—	
And a terrible heart-thrill,	
If you have no power of giving:	
An arm of aid to the weak,
A friendly hand to the friendless,	
Kind words, so short to speak,	
But whose echo is endless:	
The world is wide,—these things are small,	
They may be nothing, but they are All.	

The moment we think we have learnt	
The lore of the all-wise One,	
By which we could stand unburnt,	
On the ridge of the seething sun:	
The moment we grasp at the clue,
Long-lost and strangely riven,	
Which guides our soul to the True,	
And the Poet to Heaven.	
The world is wide,—these things are small,—	
If they be nothing, what is there at all?

Let me this gondola boat compare to the slumberous cradle,
And to a spacious bier liken the cover demure;
Thus on the Great Canal through life we are swaying and swimming
Onward with never a care, coffin and cradle between.
