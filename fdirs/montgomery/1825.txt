T:O Spirit of the living God
U:2 Corinthians 3:3
F:O Spirit of the living God

O Spirit of the living God,
In all Thy plenitude of grace,
Where'er the foot of man hath trod,
Descend on our apostate race.

Give tongues of fire and hearts of love
To preach the reconciling Word,
Give power and unction from above,
Whene'er the joyful sound is heard.

Be darkness, at Thy coming, light;
Confusion, order in Thy path;
Souls without strength inspire with might;
Bid mercy triumph over wrath.

O Spirit of the Lord, prepare
All the round earth her God to meet;
Breathe Thou abroad like morning air,
Till hearts of stone begin to beat.

Baptize the nations; far and nigh
The triumphs of the cross record;
The Name of Jesus glorify,
Till every kindred call Him Lord.

N:Originally written in 1823 "to be sung at the Public Meeting of the Auxiliary Missionary Society for the West Riding of Yorkshire, to be sung in Salem Chapel, Leeds, June 4, 1823," the first printing of this hymn was a flysheet for the meeting. It was then printed in the Evangelical Magazine, August 1823. Montgomery revised it to be printed in his Christian Psalmist, 1825. He called it, "The Spirit Accompanying the Word of God," and also in his Original Hymns, 1853. [Fra http://hymnuts.luthersem.edu/hcompan/]
