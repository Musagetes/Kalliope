T:To my son
F:Those flaxen locks, those eyes of blue
N:Skrevet 1807, først trykt i 1830.


Those flaxen locks, those eyes of blue
Bright as thy mother's in their hue;
Those rosy lips, whose dimples play
And smile to steal the heart away,
Recall a scene of former joy,
And touch thy fathers heart, my Boy!

And thou canst lisp a father's name -
Ah, William, were thine own the same,­
No self'reproach - but, let me cease - 
My care for thee shall purchase peace; 
Thy mother's shade shall smile in joy,
And pardon all the past, my Boy!

Her lowly grave the turf has prest,
And thou hast known a stranger's breast;
Derision sneers upon thy birth,
And yields thee scarce a name on earth;
Yet shall not these one hops destroy,-
A Father's heart is throe, my Boy!

Why, let the world unfeeling frown,
Must I fond Nature's claim disown? 
Ah, no - though moralists reprove,
I hail thee, dearest child of love,
Fair cherub, pledge of youth and joy­
A Father guards thy birth, my Boy!

Oh, 'twill be sweet in thee to trace, 
Ere age has wrinkled o'er my face, 
Ere half my glass of life is run, 
At once a brother and a son; 
And all my wane of years employ 
In justice done to thee, my Boy!

Although so young thy heedless sire, 
Youth will not damp parental fire; 
And, wert thou still less dear to me, 
While Helen's form revives in thee, 
The breast which beat to former joy,
Will ne'er desert its pledge, my Boy!

T:The isles of Greece
F:The isles of Greece!

The isles of Greece! the isles of Greece  
  Where burning Sappho loved and sung,  
Where grew the arts of war and peace,  
  Where Delos rose, and Phoebus sprung!  
Eternal summer gilds them yet,          
But all, except their sun, is set.  
 
The Scian and the Teian muse,  
  The hero's harp, the lover's lute,  
Have found the fame your shores refuse:  
  Their place of birth alone is mute   
To sounds which echo further west  
Than your sires' 'Islands of the Blest.  
 
The mountains look on Marathon?  
  And Marathon looks on the sea;  
And musing there an hour alone,   
  I dream'd that Greece might still be free;  
For standing on the Persians' grave,  
I could not deem myself a slave.  
 
A king sate on the rocky brow  
  Which looks o'er sea-born Salamis;   
And ships, by thousands, lay below,  
  And men in nations;?all were his!  
He counted them at break of day?  
And when the sun set, where were they?  
 
And where are they? and where art thou,   
  My country? On thy voiceless shore  
The heroic lay is tuneless now?  
  The heroic bosom beats no more!  
And must thy lyre, so long divine,  
Degenerate into hands like mine?   
 
'Tis something in the dearth of fame,  
  Though link'd among a fetter'd race,  
To feel at least a patriot's shame,  
  Even as I sing, suffuse my face;  
For what is left the poet here?   
For Greeks a blush?for Greece a tear.  
 
Must we but weep o'er days more blest?  
  Must we but blush??Our fathers bled.  
Earth! render back from out thy breast  
  A remnant of our Spartan dead!   
Of the three hundred grant but three,  
To make a new Thermopyl?!  
 
What, silent still? and silent all?  
  Ah! no;?the voices of the dead  
Sound like a distant torrent's fall,   
  And answer, 'Let one living head,  
But one, arise,?we come, we come!'  
'Tis but the living who are dumb.  
 
In vain?in vain: strike other chords;  
  Fill high the cup with Samian wine!   
Leave battles to the Turkish hordes,  
  And shed the blood of Scio's vine:  
Hark! rising to the ignoble call?  
How answers each bold Bacchanal!  
 
You have the Pyrrhic dance as yet;   
  Where is the Pyrrhic phalanx gone?  
Of two such lessons, why forget  
  The nobler and the manlier one?  
You have the letters Cadmus gave?  
Think ye he meant them for a slave?   
 
Fill high the bowl with Samian wine!  
  We will not think of themes like these!  
It made Anacreon's song divine:  
  He served?but served Polycrates?  
A tyrant; but our masters then   
Were still, at least, our countrymen.  
 
The tyrant of the Chersonese  
  Was freedom's best and bravest friend;  
That tyrant was Miltiades!  
  O that the present hour would lend   
Another despot of the kind!  
Such chains as his were sure to bind.  
 
Fill high the bowl with Samian wine!  
  On Suli's rock, and Parga's shore,  
Exists the remnant of a line   
  Such as the Doric mothers bore;  
And there, perhaps, some seed is sown,  
The Heracleidan blood might own.  
 
Trust not for freedom to the Franks?  
  They have a king who buys and sells;   
In native swords and native ranks  
  The only hope of courage dwells:  
But Turkish force and Latin fraud  
Would break your shield, however broad.  
 
Fill high the bowl with Samian wine!   
  Our virgins dance beneath the shade?  
I see their glorious black eyes shine;  
  But gazing on each glowing maid,  
My own the burning tear-drop laves,  
To think such breasts must suckle slaves.   
 
Place me on Sunium's marbled steep,  
  Where nothing, save the waves and I,  
May hear our mutual murmurs sweep;  
  There, swan-like, let me sing and die:  
A land of slaves shall ne'er be mine?   
Dash down yon cup of Samian wine!
