There is a garden in her face
    There is a garden in her face,
Where roses and white lilies grow;
    A heav'nly paradise is that place,
Wherein all pleasant fruits do flow.
    There cherries grow, which none may buy
    Till "Cherry ripe!" themselves do cry.

    Those cherries fairly do enclose
Of orient pearl a double row;
    Which when her lovely laughter shows,
They look like rosebuds filled with snow.
    Yet them nor peer nor prince can buy,
    Till "Cherry ripe!" themselves do cry.

    Her eyes like angels watch them still;
Her brows like bended bows do stand,
    Threatening with piercing frowns to kill
All that attempt with eye or hand
    Those sacred cherries to come nigh,
    Till "Cherry ripe!" themselves do cry.
