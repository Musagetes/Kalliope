T:They say my verse is sad: no wonder
F:They say my verse is sad: no wonder
N:Andre udgaver har "Tears of" for "Rue for".

They say my verse is sad: no wonder.
    Its narrow measure spans
Rue for eternity, and sorrow
    Not mine, but man's.

This is for all ill-treated fellows
    Unborn and unbegot,
For them to read when they're in trouble
    And I am not.

F:If in that Syrian garden, ages slain

If in that Syrian garden, ages slain,
You sleep, and know not you are dead in vain,
Nor even in dreams behold how dark and bright
Ascends in smoke and fire by day and night
The hate you died to quench and could but fan,
Sleep well and see no morning, son of man.
 
But if, the grave rent and the stone rolled by,
At the right hand of majesty on high
You sit, and sitting so remember yet
Your tears, your agony and bloody sweat,
Your cross and passion and the life you gave,
Bow hither out of heaven and see and save.

TI:When Israel out of Egypt came
TOC:II (When Israel out of Egypt came)
F:When Israel out of Egypt came
N:De sidste tre strofers tilknytning til de første fem er tvivlsom og i hvert fald ottende strofe hænger ikke organisk sammen med de andre, syvende strofe bærer alle præg af at være afsluttende. Archie Burnett har dem som "Additional stanzas" i sin udgave og de er medtaget her for fuldstændighedens skyld.

When Israel out of Egypt came
    Safe in the sea they trod;
By day in cloud, by night in flame,
    Went on before them God.
 
He brought them with a stretched out hand
    Dry-footed through the foam,
Past sword and famine, rock and sand,
    Lust and rebellion, home.
 
I never over Horeb heard
    The blast of advent blow;
No fire-faced prophet brought me word
    Which way behoved me go.
 
Ascended is the cloudy flame,
    The mount of thunder dumb;
The tokens that to Israel came,
    To me they have not come.
 
I see the country far away
    Where I shall never stand;
The heart goes where no footstep may
    Into the promised land.
 
[The realm I look upon and die
    Another man will own;
He shall attain the heaven that I
    Perish and have not known.
 
But I will go where they are hid
    That never were begot,
To my inheritance amid
    The nation that is not.
  
When mixed with me the sandstorms drift
    And nerve and thew and brain
Are ashes for the air to lift
    And lightly shower again.]

TI:For these of old the trader
TOC:III (For these of old the trader)
F:For these of old the trader

For these of old the trader
    Unpearled the Indian seas,
The nations of the nadir
    Were diamondless for these;
 
A people prone and haggard
    Beheld their lightnings hurled:
All round, like Sinai, staggered
    The sceptre-shaken world.
 
But now their coins are tarnished,
    Their towers decayed away,
Their kingdom swept and garnished
    For haler kings than they;
 
Their arms the rust hath eaten,
    Their statutes none regard:
Arabia shall not sweeten
    Their dust, with all her nard.
 
They cease from long vexation,
    Their nights, their days are done,
The pale, the perished nation
    That never see the sun;
 
From the old deep-dusted annals
    The years erase their tale,
And round them race the channels
    That take no second sail.

F:O youth whose heart is right

O youth whose heart is right,
    Whose loins are girt to gain
The hell-defended height
    Where Virtue beckons plain;

Who seest the stark array
    And hast not stayed to count
But singly wilt assay
    The many-cannoned mount:

Well is thy war begun;
    Endure, be strong and strive;
But think not, O my son,
    To save thy soul alive.

Wilt thou be true and just
    And clean and kind and brave?
Well; but for all thou dost,
    Be sure it shall not save.

Thou, when the night falls deep,
    Thou, though the mount be won,
High heart, thou shalt but sleep
    The sleep denied to none.

Others, or ever thou,
    To scale those heights were sworn;
And some achieved, but now
    They never see the morn.

How shouldst thou keep the prize?
    Thou wast not born for aye.
Content thee if thine eyes
    Behold it in thy day.

O youth that wilt attain,
    On, for thine hour is short.
It may be thou shalt gain
    The hell-defended fort.

F:The snows are fled away, leaves on the shaws

The snows are fled away, leaves on the shaws
    And grasses in the mead renew their birth,
The river to the river-bed withdraws,
    And altered is the fashion of the earth.

The Nymphs and Graces three put off their fear
    And unapparelled in the woodland play.
The swift hour and the brief prime of the year
    Say to the soul, <i>Thou wast not born for aye</i>.

Thaw follows frost; hard on the heel of spring
    Treads summer sure to die, for hard on hers
Comes autumn, with his apples scattering;
    Then back to wintertide, when nothing stirs.

But oh, whate'er the sky-led seasons mar,
    Moon upon moon rebuilds it with her beams:
Come <i>we</i> where Tullus and where Ancus are,
    And good Aeneas, we are dust and dreams.

Torquatus, if the gods in heaven shall add
    The morrow to the day, what tongue has told?
Feast then thy heart, for what thy heart has had
    The fIngers of no heir will ever hold.

When thou descendest once the shades among,
    The stern assize and equal judgment o'er,
Not thy long lineage nor thy golden tongue,
    No, nor thy righteousness, shall friend thee more.

Night holds Hippolytus the pure of stain,
    Diana steads him nothing, he must stay;
And Theseus leaves Pirithous in the chain
    The love of comrades cannot take away.

TI:I to my perils
TOC:VI (I to my perils)
F:I to my perils

I to my perils
    Of cheat and charmer
    Came clad in armour
By stars benign.
Hope lies to mortals
    And most believe her,
    But man's deceiver
Was never mine.

The thoughts of others
    Were light and fleeting,
    Of lovers' meeting
Or luck or fame.
Mine were of trouble,
    And mine were steady,
    So I was ready
When trouble came.

F:Stars, I have seen them fall

Stars, I have seen them fall,
    But when they drop and die
No star is lost at all
    From all the star-sown sky.
The toil of all that be
    Helps not the primal fault;
It rains into the sea,
    And still the sea is salt.

N:Her er sandsynligvis tale om tre fragmenter der af udgiveren blev klistret sammen til en helhed. 

Give me a land of boughs in leaf,
    A land of trees that stand;
Where trees are fallen, there is grief;
    I love no leafless land.

Alas, the country whence I fare,
    It is where would stay;
And where I would not, it is there
    That I shall be for aye.

And one remembers, and one forgets,
    But 'tis not found again,
Not though they hale in crimsoned nets
    The sunset from the main.

F:When green buds hang in the elm like dust

When green buds hang in the elm like dust
    And sprinkle the lime like rain,
Forth 1 wander, forth I must
    And drink of life again.
Forth I must by hedgerow bowers
    To look at the leaves uncurled
And stand in the fields where cuckoo-flowers
    Are lying about the world.

The weeping Pleiads wester,
    And the moon is under seas;
From bourn to bourn of midnight
    Far sighs the rainy breeze:

It sighs from a lost country
    To a land I have not known;
The weeping Pleiads wester,
    And I lie down alone.

The rainy Pleiads wester,

The stroke of midnight ceases,
    And I lie down alone.

The rainy Pleiads wester
    And seek beyond the sea
The head that I shall dream of,
    And 'twill not dream of me.

F:I promise nothing: friends will part

I promise nothing: friends will part;
    All things may end, for all began;
And truth and singleness of heart
    Are mortal even as is man.
 
But this unlucky love should last
    When answered passions thin to air;
Eternal fate so deep has cast
    Its sure foundation of despair.

N:Som man nok kan se et ufuldstændigt digt; mellem klammerne må man forestille sig jeg-personen tiltale "my lad", "my kind and foolish comrade."

I lay me down and slumber
    And every morn revive.
Whose is the night-long breathing
    That keeps a man alive?

When I was off to dreamland
    And left my limbs forgot,
Who stayed at home to mind them,
    And breathed when I did not?

[

                                 ]
    For oh, 'twas never I.				

If I were you, young fellow,
    I'd save what brave breath I had,
For sleepers cut the waking:
    Oh, spare your pains, my lad.

- I waste my time in talking,
    No heed at all takes he,
My kind and foolish comrade
    That breathes all night for me.

The farms of home lie lost in even,
    I see far off the steeple stand;
West and away from here to heaven,
    Still is the land.

There if I go no girl will greet me,
    No comrade hollo from the hill,
No dog run down the yard to meet me:
    The land is still.

The land is still by farm and steeple,
    And still for me the land may stay:
There I was friends with perished people,
    And there lie they.

F:Tarry, delight; so seldom met

Tarry, delight; so seldom met,
    So sure to perish, tarry still;
Forbear to cease or languish yet,
    Though soon you must and will.

By Sestos town, in Hero's tower,
    On Hero's heart Leander lies;
The signal torch has burned its hour
    And sputters as it dies.

Beneath him, in the nighted firth,
    Between two continents complain
The seas he swam from earth to earth
    And he must swim again.

F:How clear, how lovely bright

How clear, how lovely bright,
How beautiful to sight
    Those beams of morning play,
How heaven laughs out with glee
Where, like a bird set free,
Up from the eastern sea
    Soars the delightful day.

To-day I shall be strong,
No more shall yield to wrong,
    Shall squander life no more;
Days lost, I know not how,
I shall retrieve them now;
Now I shall keep the vow
    I never kept before.

- Ensanguining the skies
How heavily it dies
    Into the west away;
Past touch and sight and sound,
Not further to be found,
How hopeless under ground
    Falls the remorseful day.

Bells in tower at evening toll,
And the day forsakes the soul;
Soon will evening's self be gone
And the whispering night come on.

Blame not thou the blinded light
Nor the whisper of the night:
Though the whispering night were still,
Yet the heart would counsel ill.

Delight it is in youth and May

And more delight, or so they say,
    To read in lovers' eyes.
Oh maiden, let your distaff be,
And pace the flowery meads with me,
    And I will tell you lies.

'Tis blithe to see the sunshine fail,
    And hear the land grow still
And listen till the nightingale
    Is heard beneath the hill.
Oh follow me where she is flown
Into the leafy woods alone,
    And I will work you ill.

The mill-stream, now that noises cease,
Is all that does not hold its peace;
Under the bridge it murmurs by,
And here are night and hell and I.
 
Who made the world I cannot tell:
'Tis made, and here I am in hell.
My hand, though now my knuckles bleed,
I never soiled with such a deed.
 
And so, no doubt, in time gone by
Some have suffered more than I,
Who only spend the night alone
And strike my fist upon the stone.

Like mine, the veins of these that slumber
    Leapt once with dancing fires divine;
The blood of all this noteless number
    Ran red like mine.

How still, with every pulse in station,
    Frost in the founts that used to leap,
The thralls of night, the perished nation,
    How sound they sleep!

These too, these veins which life convulses,
    Wait but a while, shall cease to bound;
I with the ice in all my pulses
    Shall sleep as sound.

The world goes none the lamer,
    For ought that I can see,
Because this cursed trouble
    Has struck my days and me.
 
The stars of heaven are steady,
    The founded hills remain,
Though I to earth and darkness
    Return in blood and pain.
 
Farewell to all belongings
    I won or bought or stole;
Farewell, my lusty carcase,
    Farewell, my aery soul.
 
Oh worse remains for others
    And worse to fear had I
Than so at four-and-twenty
    To lay me down and die.

Come to the stolen waters,
    Drink and your soul shall live.

Come to the stolen waters,
    And leap the guarded pale,
And pull the flower in season
    Before desire shall fail.

It shall not last for ever,
    No more than earth and skies;
But he that drinks in season
    Shall live before he dies.

June suns, you cannot store them
    To warm the winter's cold,
The lad that hopes for heaven
    Shall fill his mouth with mould.

And nought to help it in this dull head:

Be good to the lad that loves you true
And the soul that was born to die for you,

Because I liked you better
    Than suits a man to say,
It irked you, and I promised
    To throw the thought away.
 
To put the world between us
    We parted, stiff and dry;
,,Good-bye,'' said you, ,,forget me.''

And no tall flower to meet you

Halt by the headstone naming
    The heart no longer stirred,
And say the lad that loved you
    Was one that kept his word.

The numberless, the lonely,

It peoples towns, and towers

On forelands high in heaven,
    'Tis many a year gone by,
Amidst the fall of even

Before our foolish faces
    Lay lands we did not see;
Our eyes were in the places
    Where we should never be.

,,Oh, the pearl seas are yonder,
    The gold and amber shore;
Shires where the girls are fonder,
    Towns where the pots hold more.
And here fret we and moulder
    By grange and rick and shed
And every moon are older,
    And soon we shall be dead.''

Heigho, 'twas true and pity;
    But there we lads must stay.
Troy was a steepled city,
    But Troy was far away.
And home we turned lamenting
    To plains we longed to leave,
And silent hills indenting
    The orange band of eve.

I see the air benighted
    And all the dusking dales,
And lamps in England lighted,
    And evening wrecked on Wales.
And starry darkness paces
    The road from sea to sea,
And blots the foolish faces
    Of my poor friends and me.

Young is the blood that yonder
    Strides out the dusty mile,
And breasts the hill-side highway
    And whistles loud the while,
    And vaults the stile.

Yet backs, I think, have burdens
    And shoulders carry care:
So fell to flesh its portion
    When I and not my heir
    Was young and there.

On miry meads in winter
    The football sprang and fell,
May stuck the land with wickets:
    For all the eye could tell
    The world went well.

Yet well, God knows, it went not,
    God knows, it went awry;
For me, one flowery Maytime,
    It went so ill that I
    Designed to die.

And if so long I carry
    The lot that season marred,
'Tis that the sons of Adam
    Are not so evil-starred
    As they are hard.

Young is the blood that yonder
    Succeeds to rick and fold,
Fresh are the form and favour
    And new the minted mould:
    The thoughts are old.

    To live and shame the land from which we sprung.
Life, to be sure, is nothing much to lose,
    But young men think it is, and we were young.

I did not lose my heart in summer's even,
    When roses to the moonrise burst apart:
When plumes were under heel and lead was flying,
    In blood and smoke and flame I lost my heart.

I lost it to a soldier and a foeman,
    A chap that did not kill me, but he tried;
That took the sabre straight and took it striking
    And laughed and kissed his hand to me and died.

By shores and woods and steeples
    Rejoicing hearts receive
Poured on a hundred peoples
    The far-shed alms of eve.

Her hands are filled with slumber
    For world-wide labourers worn;
Yet those are more in number
    That know her not from morn.

Now who sees night for ever,
    He sees no happier sight:
Night and no moon and never
    A star upon the night.

There in their graves my comrades are,
    In my grave I am not.

I too was taught the trade of man
    And spelt the lesson plain;
But they, when I forgot and ran,
    Remembered and remain.

Farewell to a name and a number
    Resigned again
To darkness and silence and slumber
    In blood and pain.
 
So time coils round in ring
    And home comes he
A soldier cheap to the King
    And dear to me;
 
So smothers in blood the burning
    And flaming flight
Of valour and truth returning
    To dust and night.

    I was not like to find,
The voice he begged for pence with brought

Oh no, lad, never touch your cap;
    It is not my half-crown:
You have it from a better chap
    That long ago lay down.

Once he stept out but now my friend
    Is not in marching trim
And you must tramp to the world's end
    To touch your cap to him.

When he's returned I'll tell him - oh,
    Dear fellow, I forgot:
Time was you would have cared to know,
    But now it matters not.

I mourn you, and you heed not how;
    Unsaid the word must stay;
Last month was time enough, but now
    The news must keep for aye.

Oh, many a month before I learn
    Will find me starting still
And listening, as the days return,
    For him that never will.

Strange, strange to think his blood is cold
    And mine flows easy on,
And that straight look, that heart of gold,
    That grace, that manhood, gone.

The word unsaid will stay unsaid
    Though there was much to say;
Last month was time enough: he's dead,
    The news must keep for aye.

I wake from dreams and turning
    My vision on the height
I scan the beacons burning
    About the fields of night.

Each in its steadfast station
    Inflaming heaven they flare;
They sign with conflagration
    The empty moors of air.

The signal-fires of warning
    They blaze, but none regard;
And on through night to morning
    The world runs ruinward.

Far known to sea and shore,
    Four square and founded well,
A thousand years it bore,
    And then the belfry fell.

The steersman of Triest
    Looked where his mark should be,
But empty was the west
    And Venice under sea.

From dusty wreck dispersed
    Its stature mounts amain;
On surer foot than first
    The belfry stands again.

At to-fall of the day
    Again its curfew tolls
And burdens far away
    The green and sanguine shoals.

It looks to north and south,
    It looks to east and west;
It guides to Lido mouth
    The steersman of Triest.

Andrea, fare you well;
    Venice, farewell to thee.
The tower that stood and fell
    Is not rebuilt in me.

Smooth between sea and land
Is laid the yellow sand,
And here through summer days
The seed of Adam plays.

Here the child comes to found
His unremaining mound,
And the grown lad to score
Two names upon the shore.

Here, on the level sand,
Between the sea and land,
What shall I build or write
Against the fall of night?

Tell me of runes to grave
That hold the bursting wave,
Or bastions to design
For longer date than mine.

Shall it be Troy or Rome
I fence against the foam,
Or my own name, to stay
When I depart for aye?

Nothing: too near at hand,
Planing the figured sand,
Effacing clean and fast
Cities not built to last
And charms devised in vain,
Pours the confounding main.

Hearken, landsmen, hearken, seamen, to the tale of grief and me
Looking from the land of Biscay on the waters of the sea.

Looking from the land of Biscay over Ocean to the sky
On the far-beholding foreland paced at even grief and I.
There, as warm the west was burning and the east uncoloured cold,
Down the waterway of sunset drove to shore a ship of gold.
Gold of mast and gold of cordage, gold of sail to sight was she,
And she glassed her ensign golden in the waters of the sea.

Oh, said I, my friend and lover, take we now that ship and sail
Outward in the ebb of hues and steer upon the sunset trail;
Leave the night to fall behind us and the clouding countries leave:
Help for you and me is yonder, in a haven west of eve.

Under hill she neared the harbour, till the gazer could behold
On the golden deck the steersman standing at the helm of gold,
Man and ship and sky and water burning in a single flame;
And the mariner of Ocean, he was calling as he came:
From the highway of the sunset he was shouting on the sea, 
,,Landsman of the land of Biscay, have you help for grief and me?''

When I heard I did not answer, I stood mute and shook my head:
Son of earth and son of Ocean, much we thought and nothing said.
Grief and I abode the nightfall, to the sunset grief and he
Turned them from the land of Biscay on the waters of the sea.

Good-night; ensured release,
Imperishable peace,

While sea abides, and land,
And earth's foundations stand,
    And heaven endures.

When earth's foundations flee,
Nor sky nor land nor sea
    At all is found,
Content you, let them burn:
It is not your concern;
    Sleep on, sleep sound.
