T:A Red, Red Rose
F:O my Luve 's like a red, red rose

O my Luve 's like a red, red rose
That 's newly sprung in June:
O my Luve 's like the melodie
That's sweetly play'd in tune!

As fair art thou, my bonnie lass,
So deep in luve am I:
And I will luve thee still, my dear,
Till a' the seas gang dry:

Till a' the seas gang dry, my dear,
And the rocks melt wi' the sun;
I will luve thee still, my dear,
While the sands o' life shall run.

And fare thee weel, my only Luve,
And fare thee weel a while!
And I will come again, my Luve,
Tho' it were ten thousand mile.

T:To Mary in Heaven
F:Thou lingering star, with less'ning ray

Thou lingering star, with less'ning ray, 
       That lov'st to greet the early morn, 
Again thou usherast in the day 
       My Mary from my soul was torn. 
O Mary, dear departed shade 
       Where is thy place of blissful rest? 
See'st thou thy lover lowly laid? 
       Hear'st thou the groans that rend his breast?

That sacred hour can I forget? 
       Can I forget the hallow'd grove 
Where, by the winding Ayr, we met, 
       To live one day of parting love? 
Eternity cannot efface 
       Those records dear of transports past, 
Thy image at our last embrace--- 
       Ah! little thought we 'twas our last!

Ayr, gurgling, kiss'd his pebbled shore, 
       O'erhung with wild-woods, thickening green; 
The fragrant birch and hawthorn hoar, 
       Twin'd amorous round the raptur'd scene; 
The flowers sprang wanton to be prest 
       The birds sang love on every spray 
Till too, too soon, the glowing west, 
       Proclaim'd the speed of winged day.

Still o'er these scenes my mem'ry wakes, 
       And fondly broods with miser-care; 
Time but th' impression stronger makes, 
       As streams their channels deeper wear. 
O Mary! dear departed shade! 
       Where is thy place of blissful rest? 
See'st thou thy lover lowly laid? 
       Hear'st thou the groans that rend his breast?
