T:To Lucasta. Going Beyond the Warres
F:Tell me not, (sweet,) I am unkinde

  I.

Tell me not, (sweet,) I am unkinde, 
   That from the nunnerie 
Of thy chaste breast and quiet minde 
   To warre and armes I flie.

  II.

True: a new Mistresse now I chase, 
   The first foe in the field;
And with a stronger faith imbrace 
   A sword, a horse, a shield.

  III.

Yet this inconstancy is such, 
   As you too shall adore; 
I could not love thee, dear, so much, 
   Lov'd I not Honour more.
