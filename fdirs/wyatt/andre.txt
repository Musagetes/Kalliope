T:Behold, love, thy power how she dispiseth
F:Behold, love, thy power how she dispiseth
N:6 Wepened = weaponed<br>7 the = thee<br>7 liff = life<br>10 the = thee<br>14 the = thee

Behold, love, thy power how she dispiseth,
My great payne, how litle she regardeth.
The holy oth, wherof she taketh no cure 
Broken she hath, and yet she bideth sure
Right at her ease and litle she dredeth. 
Wepened thou art and she unarmed sitteth.
To the disdaynfull her liff she ledeth, 
To me spitefull withoute cause or mesure. 
            Behold love. 
  
I ame in hold: if pitie the meveth, 
Goo bend thy bowe that stony hertes breketh, 
And with some stroke revenge the displeasure
Of thee and him, that sorrowe doeth endure, 
And, as his lorde, the lowly entreateth. 
            Behold love.

T:Yf it be so that I forsake the
F:Yf it be so that I forsake the
N:1 the = thee<br>3 hert = heart<br>12 perdy = par dieu

Yf it be so that I forsake the
As banysshed from thy company, 
Yet my hert, my mynde and myn affection
Shall still remain in thy perfection, 
And right as thou lyst so order me. 
But som would saye in their opinion 
Revoulsed is thy good intention;
Then may I well blame thy cruelte
            Yf it be so. 

But myself I say on this fasshion:
I have her hert in my possession, 
And of it self there cannot, perdy, 
By no meanes love an herteles body; 
And on my faith good is the reason
            If it be so.

T:Goo, burnyng sighes, Vnto the frosen hert

Goo, burnyng sighes, Vnto the frosen hert.
Goo breke the Ise which pites paynfull dert 
Myght never perse, and if mortall prayer
In hevyn may be herd, at lest I desire
That deth or mercy be end of my smart.
Take with the payne whereof I have my part
And eke the flame from which I cannot stert 
And leve me then in rest, I you require. 
            Goo, burning sighes.

I must goo worke, I se, by craft and art
For trueth and faith in her is laide apart.
Alas, I cannot therefore assaill her 
With pitefull plaint and scalding fyer 
That oute of my brest doth straynably stert.
            Goo, burning sighes.

T:What vaileth trouth or by it to take payn

N:3 fle from dowblenes = flee from doubleness<br>4 Sythens = since<br>6 fain = feign<br>7 hert = heart<br>11 gile = guile<br>13 maisteres = mistress

What vaileth trouth or by it to take payn,
To stryve by stedfastnes for to attayne
To be juste and true and fle from dowblenes,
Sythens all alike, where ruleth craftines, 
Rewarded is boeth fals and plain?
Sonest he spedeth, that moost can fain; 
True meanyng hert is had in disdayn. 
Against deceipte and dowblenes 
            What vaileth trouth? 
  
Decyved is he by crafty trayn
That meaneth no gile and doeth remayn 
Within the trapp withoute redresse
But for to love, lo, such a maisteres, 
Whose crueltie nothing can refrayn, 
            What vaileth trouth?

T:Helpe me to seke for I lost it there
F:Helpe me to seke for I lost it there
N:1 seke = seek<br>5 appere = appair<br>7 Syns = since<br>8 lese = lose<br>12 I wis = iwis = certainly/indeed<br>12 dere = dear

Helpe me to seke for I lost it there;
And if that ye have founde it, ye that be here, 
And seke to convaye it secretely, 
Handell it soft and trete it tenderly
Or els it will plain and then appere. 
But rather restore it mannerly
Syns that I do aske it thus honestly,
For to lese it it sitteth me to neere; 
            Helpe me to seke. 

Alas, and is there no remedy
But have I thus lost it wilfully?
I wis it was a thing all to dere 
To be bestowed and wist not where;
It was myn hert, I pray you hertely 
            Helpe me to seke.

T:Thou hast no faith of him that hath none
F:Thou hast no faith of him that hath none
N:2 nedes = needs<br>4 Eche = each<br>8 syns = since<br>10 the = thee<br>13 to = too<br>14 chaunge = change

Thou hast no faith of him that hath none,
But thou must love him nedes by reason, 
For as saieth a proverbe notable, 
Eche thing seketh his semblable,
And thou hast thyn of thy condition. 
Yet is it not the thing I passe on, 
Nor hote nor cold of myn affection, 
For syns thyn hert is so mutable, 
            Thou hast no faith. 

I thought the true withoute exception,  
But I perceve I lacked discretion 
To fasshion faith to wordes mutable:
Thy thought is to light and variable,
To chaunge so oft withoute occasion, 
            Thou hast no faith.

F:Ye old mule that think your self so fayre
N:2 Leve of = leave off<br>8 layer = lair<br>13 syns = since<br>13 heres = hairs<br>14 seke = seek

Ye old mule that think your self so fayre, 
Leve of with craft your beautie to repaire, 
For it is true withoute any fable
No man setteth more by riding in your saddell; 
To muche travaill so do your train apaire, 
            Ye old mule.

With fals savours though you deceve th'ayer, 
Who so tast you shall well perceve your layer
Savoureth som what of a kappurs stable, 
            Ye old mule.

Ye must now serve to market and to faire, 
All for the burden, for pannyers a paire; 
For syns gray heres ben powdered in your sable, 
The thing ye seke for you must your self enable 
To pourchase it by payment and by prayer, 
            Ye old mule.

What no, perdy, ye may be sure! 
Thinck not to make me to your lure
With wordes and chere so contrarieng, 
Swete and sowre contrewaing; 
To much it were still to endure. 
Trouth is tryed where craft is in vre; 
But though ye have had my hertes cure 
Trow ye I dote withoute ending?
            What no, perdy!

Though that with pain I do procure 
For to forgett that ons was pure
Within my hert shall still that thing 
Vnstable, vnsure and wavering
Be in my mynde withoute recure?
            What no, perdy!
