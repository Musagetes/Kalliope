T:The universal prayer
F:Father of All! in every Age

Father of All! in every Age,
In every Clime ador'd,
By Saint, by Savage, and by Sage,
Jehovah, Jove, or Lord! 

Thou Great First Cause, least Understood!
Who all my Sense confin'd
To know but this, -- that Thou art Good,
And that my self am blind: 

Yet gave me, in this dark Estate,
To see the Good from Ill;
And binding Nature fast in Fate,
Left free the Human Will. 

What Conscience dictates to be done,
Or warns me not to doe,
This, teach me more than Hell to shun,
That, more than Heav'n pursue. 

What Blessings thy free Bounty gives,
Let me not cast away;
For God is pay'd when Man receives,
T' enjoy, is to obey. 

Yet not to Earth's contracted Span,
Thy Goodness let me bound;
Or think Thee Lord alone of Man,
When thousand Worlds are round. 

Let not this weak, unknowing hand
Presume Thy Bolts to throw,
And deal Damnation round the land,
On each I judge thy Foe. 

If I am right, oh teach my heart
Still in the right to say;
If I am wrong, Thy Grace impart
To find that better Way. 

Save me alike from foolish Pride,
Or impious Discontent,
At ought thy Wisdom has deny'd,
Or ought thy Goodness lent. 

Teach me to feel another's Woe;
To hide the Fault I see;
That Mercy I to others show,
That Mercy show to me. 

Mean tho' I am, not wholly so
Since quicken'd by thy Breath,
O lead me wheresoe'er I go,
Thro' this day's Life, or Death: 

This day, be Bread and Peace my Lot;
All else beneath the Sun,
Thou know'st if best bestow'd, or not;
And let Thy Will be done. 

To Thee, whose Temple is all Space,
Whose Altar, Earth, Sea, Skies:
One Chorus let all Being raise!
All Nature's Incense rise!

T:Ode on solitude
F:Happy the man, whose wish and care
K:ode

Happy the man, whose wish and care
A few paternal acres bound,
Content to breathe his native air,
In his own ground. 

Whose herds with milk, whose fields with bread,
Whose flocks supply him with attire,
Whose trees in summer yield him shade,
In winter fire. 

Blest! who can unconcern'dly find
Hours, days, and years slide soft away,
In health of body, peace of mind,
Quiet by day, 

Sound sleep by night; study and ease
Together mix'd; sweet recreation,
And innocence, which most doth please,
With meditation. 

Thus let me live, unseen, unknown;
Thus unlamented let me dye;
Steal from the world, and not a stone
Tell where I lye.

T:Epitaph.
U:On John Lord Caryll
F:A manly Form; a bold, yet modest mind

A manly Form; a bold, yet modest mind;
Sincere, tho' prudent; constant, yet resign'd;
Honour unchang'd; a Principle profest;
Fix'd to one side, but mod'rate to the rest;
An honest Courtier, and a Patriot too;
Just to his Prince, and to his Country true:
All these were join'd in one, yet fail'd to save
The Wise, the Learn'd, the Virtuous, and the Brave;
Lost, like the common Plunder of the Grave!
Ye Few, whom better Genius does inspire,
Exalted Souls, inform'd with purer Fire!
Go now, learn all vast Science can impart;
Go fathom Nature, take the Heights of Art!
Rise higher yet: learn ev'n yourselves to know;
Nay, to yourselves alone that knowledge owe.
Then, when you seem above mankind to soar,
Look on this marble, and be vain no more!

T:On a lady who P---st at the tragedy of Cato
F:While maudlin Whigs deplor'd their Cato's Fate

While maudlin Whigs deplor'd their <I>Cato's</I> Fate,
Still with dry Eyes the Tory <I>Celia</I> sate,
But while her Pride forbids her Tears to flow,
The gushing Waters find a Vent below:
Tho' secret, yet with copious Grief she mourns,
Like twenty River-Gods with all their Urns.
Let others screw their Hypocritick Face,
She shews her Grief in a sincerer Place;
There Nature reigns, and Passion void of Art,
For that Road leads directly to the Heart.

T:To Mr. John Moore, Author of the Celebrated Worm-Powder
F:How much, egregious Moor, are we

How much, egregious <I>Moor</I>, are we
Deceiv'd by Shews and Forms!
Whate'er we think, whate'er we see,
All Humankind are Worms.

Man is a very Worm by Birth,
Vile Reptile, weak, and vain!
A while he crawls upon the Earth,
Then shrinks to Earth again.

That Woman is a Worm we find,
E'er since our Grandame's Evil;
She first convers'd with her own Kind,
That antient Worm, the Devil.

The Learn'd themselves we Book-Worms name;
The Blockhead is a Slow-worm;
The Nymph whose Tail is all on Flame
Is aptly term'd a Glow-worm:

The Fops are painted Butterflies,
That flutter for a Day;
First from a Worm they take their Rise,
And in a Worm decay:

The Flatterer an Earwig grows;
Thus Worms suit all Conditions;
Misers are Muckworms, Silk-worms Beaus,
And Death-watches Physicians.

That Statesmen have the Worm, is seen
By all their winding Play;
Their Conscience is a Worm within,
That gnaws them Night and Day.

Ah <I>Moore</I>! thy skill were well employ'd,
And greater Gain would rise,
if thou could'st make the Courtier void
The Worm that never dies!

O learned Friend of <I>Abchurch-Lane</I>,
Who sett'st our Entrails free!
Vain is thy Art, thy Powder vain,
Since Worms shall eat ev'n thee.

Our Fate thou ounly can'st adjourn
Some few short Years, no more!
Ev'n <I>Button's</I> Wits to Worms shall turn,
Who Maggots were before.

T:Bounce to Fop
U:An heroick epistle from a dog at Twickenham to a dog at court
F:To thee, sweet Fop, these Lines I send

To thee, sweet <I>Fop</I>, these Lines I send,
Who, tho' no Spaniel, am a Friend.
Tho, once my Tail in wanton play,
Now frisking this, and then that way,
Chanc'd, with a Touch of just the Tip,
To hurt your Lady-lap-dog-ship;
Yet thence to think I'd bite your Head off!
Sure <I>Bounce</I> is one you never read of.

FOP! you can dance, and make a Leg,
Can fetch and carry, cringe and beg,
And (what's the Top of all your Tricks)
Can stoop to pick up <I>Strings</I> and <I>Sticks</I>.
We Country Dogs love nobler Sport,
And scorn the Pranks of Dogs at Court.
Fye, naughty Fop! where e'er you come
To f---t and p---ss about the Room,
To lay your Head in every Lap,
And, when they think not of you -- snap!
The worst that Envy, or that Spite
E'er said of me, is, I can bite:
That sturdy Vagrants, Rogues in Rags,
Who poke at me, can make no Brags;
And that to towze such Things as <I>flutter</I>,
To honest <I>Bounce</I> is Bread and Butter.

While you, and every courtly Fop,
Fawn on the Devil for a Chop,
I've the Humanity to hate
A Butcher, tho' he brings me Meat;
And let me tell you, have a Nose,
(Whatever stinking Fops suppose)
That under Cloth of Gold or Tissue,
Can smell a Plaister, or an Issue.

Your pilf'ring Lord, with simple Pride,
May wear a Pick-lock at his Side;
My Master wants no Key of State,
For <I>Bounce</I> can keep his House and Gate.

When all such Dogs have had their Days,
As knavish <I>Pams</I>, and fawning <I>Trays</I>;
When pamper'd <I>Cupids</I>, bestly <I>Veni's</I>,
And motly, squinting <I>Harvequini's</I>,
Shall lick no more their Lady's Br---,
But die of Looseness, Claps, or Itch;
Fair <I>Thames</I> from either ecchoing Shoare
Shall hear, and dread my manly Roar.

See <I>Bounce</I>, like <I>Berecynthia</I>, crown'd
With thund'ring Offspring all around,
Beneath, beside me, and a top,
A hundred Sons! and not one <I>Fop</I>.

Before my Children set your Beef,
Not one true <I>Bounce</I> will be a Thief;
Not one without Permission feed,
(Tho' some of F---'s hungry Breed)
But whatsoe'er the Father's Race,
From me they suck a little Grace.
While your fine Whelps learn all to steal,
Bred up by Hand and Chick and Veal.

My Eldest-born resides not far,
Where shines great <I>Strafford's</I> glittering Star:
My second (Child of Fortune!) waits
At <I>Burlington's</I> Palladian Gates:
A third majestically stalks
(Happiest of Dogs!) in <I>Cobham's</I> Walks:
One ushers Friends to <I>Bathurst's</I> Door;
One fawns, at <I>Oxford's</I>, on the Poor.

Nobles, who Arms or Arts adorn,
Wait for my Infants yet unborn.
None but a Peer of Wit and Grace,
Can hope a Puppy of my Race.

And O! wou'd Fate the Bliss decree
To mine (a Bliss too great for me)
That two, my tallest Sons, might grace
Attending each with stately Pace,
<I>Iulus'</I> Side, as erst <I>Evander's</I>,
To keep off Flatt'rers, Spies, and Panders,
To let no noble Slave come near,
And scare Lord <I>Fannys</I> from his Ear:
Then might a Royal Youth, and true,
Enjoy at least a Friend -- or two:
A Treasure, which, of Royal kind,
Few but Himself deserve to find.

Then <I>Bounce</I> ('tis all that <I>Bounce</I> can crave)
Shall wag her Tail within the Grave.

And tho' no Doctors, Whig, or Tory ones,
Except the Sect of <I>Pythagoreans</I>,
Have Immortality assign'd
To any Beast, but <I>Dryden's</I> Hind:
Yet Master <I>Pope</I>, whom Truth and Sense
Shall call their Friend some Ages hence,
Tho' now on loftier Themes he sings
Than to bestow a Word on <I>Kings</I>,
Has sworn by <I>Sticks</I> (the Poet's Oath,
And Dread of Dogs and Poets both)
Man and his Works he'll soon renounce,
And roar in Numbers worthy <I>Bounce</I>.
