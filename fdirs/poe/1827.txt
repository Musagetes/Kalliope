VN:Denne digtsamling, som lang tid efter <I>Al Aaraaf, Tamerlane and Minor Poems</I> (1829), der betragtes som Poes egentlige debut, slet ikke var bekendt. Først efter 1876, hvor der blev fundet en kopi på British Museums bibliotek, anerkendte man eksistensen af denne tidlige digtsamling. I 1890 fandt man en anden kopi, og efter det hævdes der, at der har været op til 200 kopier. I dag kendes kun 12 kopier, hvoraf flere er i dårlig stand. Udgaven her stammer fra faksimiler.

Young heads are giddy, and young hearts are warm,
And made mistakes for manhood to reform. <sc>Cowper</sc>.

T:Preface
TYPE:prosa

THE greater part of the Poems which compose this little volume, were written in the year 1821-2, when the author had not completed his fourteenth year.  They were of course not intended for publication ; why they are now published concerns no one but himself.  Of the smaller pieces very little need be said ; they perhaps savour too much of Egotism ; but they were written by one too young to have any knowledge of the world but from his own breast. 

In Tamerlane, he has endeavoured to expose the folly of even <I>risking</I> the best feelings of the heart at the shrine of Ambition.  He is conscious that in this there are many faults, (besides that of the general character of the poem) which he flatters himself he could, with little trouble, have corrected, but unlike many of his predecessors, has been too fond of his early productions to amend them in his <I>old age</I>.

He will not say that he is indifferent as to the success of these Poems — it might stimulate him to other attempts — but he can safely assert that failure will not at all influence him in a resolution already adopted.  This is challenging criticism — let it be so.  <I>Nos hæc novimus esse nihil</I><footnote>Den sidste linie er fra Martials 13. bog, 2. epigram, vers 2.

T:Tamerlane
F:I have sent for thee, holy friar

I

    I have sent for thee, holy friar;
But 'twas not with the drunken hope, 
Which is but agony of desire 
To shun the fate, with which to cope 
Is more than crime may dare to dream, 
That I have call'd thee at this hour: 
Such father is not my theme — 
Nor am I mad, to deem that power 
Of earth may shrive me of the sin 
Unearthly pride hath revell'd in — 
I would not call thee fool, old man, 
But hope is not a gift of thine; 
If I can hope (O God! I can) 
It falls from an eternal shrine.

II

    The gay wall of this gaudy tower 
Grows dim around me — death is near. 
I had not thought, until this hour 
When passing from the earth, that ear 
Of any, were it not the shade 
Of one whom in life I made 
All mystery but a simple name, 
Might know the secret of a spirit 
Bow'd down in sorrow, and in shame. — 
Shame said'st thou? 

                         Aye I did inherit 
That hatred portion, with the fame, 
The worldly glory, which has shown 
A demon-light around my throne, 
Scorching my sear'd heart with a pain 
Not Hell shall make me fear again.

III

    I have not always been as now — 
The fever'd diadem on my brow 
I claim'd and won usurpingly — 
Aye — the same heritage hath giv'n 
Rome to the Cæsar — this to me; 
The heirdom of a kingly mind — 
And a proud spirit, which hath striv'n 
Triumphantly with human kind. 

    In mountain air I first drew life; 
The mists of the Taglay have shed
Nightly their dews on my young head; 
And my brain drank their venom then, 
When after day of perilous strife 
With chamois, I would seize his den 
And slumber, in my pride of power, 
The infant monarch of the hour — 
For, with the mountain dew by night, 
My soul imbib'd unhallow'd feeling; 
And I would feel its essence stealing 
In dreams upon me — while the light 
Flashing from cloud that hover'd o'er, 
Would seem to my half closing eye 
The pageantry of monarchy! 
And the deep thunder's echoing roar 
Came hurriedly upon me, telling 
Of war, and tumult, where my voice 
My own voice, silly child! was swelling 
(O how would my wild heart rejoice 
And leap within me at the cry) 
The battle-cry of victory! 
  
   *      *      *      *      * 

IV

    The rain came down upon my head 
But barely shelter'd — and the wind 
Pass'd quickly o'er me — but my mind
Was mad'ning — for 'twas man that shed 
Laurels upon me — and the rush, 
The torrent of the chilly air 
Gurgled in my pleas'd ear the crash 
Of empires, with the captive's prayer, 
The hum of suitors, the mix'd tone 
Of flatt'ry round a sov'reign's throne.

    The storm had ceas'd — and I awoke — 
Its spirit cradled me to sleep, 
And as it pass'd me by, there broke 
Strange light upon me, tho' it were 
My soul in mystery to sleep: [steep] 
For I was not as I had been; 
The child of Nature, without care, 
Or thought, save of the passing scene. —

V

    My passions, from that hapless hour, 
Usurp'd a tyranny, which men 
Have deem'd, since I have reach'd to power 
My innate nature — be it so: 
But, father, there liv'd one who, then — 
Then, in my boyhood, when their fire 
Burn'd with a still intenser glow; 
(For passion must with youth expire) 
Ev'n <I>then</I>, who deem'd this iron heart
In woman's weakness had a part.

    I have no words, alas! to tell 
The lovliness of loving well! 
Nor would I dare attempt to trace 
The breathing beauty of a face, 
Which ev'n to my impassion'd mind, 
Leaves not its memory behind. 
In spring of life have ye ne'er dwelt 
Some object of delight upon, 
With steadfast eye, till ye have felt 
The earth reel — and the vision gone? 
And I have held to mem'ry's eye 
One object — and but one — until 
Its very form hath pass'd me by, 
But left its influence with me still. 

VI

    'Tis not to thee that I should name — 
Thou can'st not —would'st not dare to think 
The magic empire of a flame 
Which ev'n upon this perilous brink 
Hath fix'd my soul, tho' unforgiv'n 
By what it lost for passion — Heav'n. 
I lov'd — and O, how tenderly! 
Yes! she was worthy of all love! 
Such as in infancy was mine
Tho' then its <I>passion</I> could not be: 
'Twas such as angel minds above 
Might envy — her young heart the shrine 
On which my ev'ry hope and thought 
Were incense — then a goodly gift — 
For they were childish, without sin, 
Pure as her young examples taught; 
Why did I leave it and adrift, 
Trust to the fickle star within

T:Dreams
F:Oh ! that my young life were a lasting dream !

Oh ! that my young life were a lasting dream ! 
My spirit not awak'ning, till the beam 
Of an Eternity should bring the morrow. 
Yes ! tho' that long dream were of hopeless sorrow. 
‘Twere better than the cold reality 
Of waking life, to him whose heart must be, 
And hath been still, upon the lovely earth, 
A chaos of deep passion, from his birth. 
But should it be — that dream eternally 
Continuing — as dreams have been to me 
In my young boyhood — should it thus be giv'n 
‘Twere folly still to hope for higher Heav'n. 
For I have revell'd when the sun was bright 
In the summer sky, in dreams of living light. 
And loveliness, — have left my very heart 
Inclines of mine imaginary apart 
From mine own home, with beings that have been 
Of mine own thought — what more could I have seen ? 
‘Twas once — and only once — and the wild hour 
From my remembrance shall not pass — some pow'r 
Or spell had bound me — 'twas the chilly wind 
Came o'er me in the night, and left behind 
Its image on my spirit — or the moon 
Shone on my slumbers in her lofty noon
Too coldly — or the stars — howe'er it was 
That dream was as that night-wind — let it pass. 
I have <I>been</I> happy, tho' in a dream. 
I have been happy — and I  love the theme : 
Dreams ! in their vivid colouring of life 
As in that fleeting, shadowy, misty strife 
Of semblance with reality which brings 
To the delirious eye, more lovely things 
Of Paradise and Love — and all our own ! 
Than young Hope in his sunniest hour hath known.
