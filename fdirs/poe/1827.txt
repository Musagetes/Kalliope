T:Dreams
F:Oh ! that my young life were a lasting dream !

Oh ! that my young life were a lasting dream ! 
My spirit not awak'ning, till the beam 
Of an Eternity should bring the morrow. 
Yes ! tho' that long dream were of hopeless sorrow. 
‘Twere better than the cold reality 
Of waking life, to him whose heart must be, 
And hath been still, upon the lovely earth, 
A chaos of deep passion, from his birth. 
But should it be — that dream eternally 
Continuing — as dreams have been to me 
In my young boyhood — should it thus be giv'n 
‘Twere folly still to hope for higher Heav'n. 
For I have revell'd when the sun was bright 
In the summer sky, in dreams of living light. 
And loveliness, — have left my very heart 
Inclines of mine imaginary apart 
From mine own home, with beings that have been 
Of mine own thought — what more could I have seen ? 
‘Twas once — and only once — and the wild hour 
From my remembrance shall not pass — some pow'r 
Or spell had bound me — 'twas the chilly wind 
Came o'er me in the night, and left behind 
Its image on my spirit — or the moon 
Shone on my slumbers in her lofty noon
Too coldly — or the stars — howe'er it was 
That dream was as that night-wind — let it pass. 
I have <I>been</I> happy, tho' in a dream. 
I have been happy — and I  love the theme : 
Dreams ! in their vivid colouring of life 
As in that fleeting, shadowy, misty strife 
Of semblance with reality which brings 
To the delirious eye, more lovely things 
Of Paradise and Love — and all our own ! 
Than young Hope in his sunniest hour hath known.
