T:His Dream
F:I swayed upon the gaudy stern

I swayed upon the gaudy stern
The butt-end of a steering-oar,
And saw wherever I could turn
A crowd upon a shore.

And though I would have hushed the crowd,
There was no mother's son but said,
,,What is the figure in a shroud
Upon a gaudy bed?''

And after running at the brim
Cried out upon that thing beneath
- It had such dignity of limb -
By the sweet name of Death.

Though I'd my finger on my lip,
What could I but take up the song?
And running crowd and gaudy ship
Cried out the whole night long,

Crying amid the glittering sea,
Naming it with ecstatic breath,
Because it had such dignity,
By the sweet name of Death.

T:A Woman Homer sung
F:If any man drew near

If any man drew near
When I was young,
I thought, ,,He holds her dear,''
And shook with hate and fear.
But O! 'twas bitter wrong
If he could pass her by
With an indifferent eye.

Whereon I wrote and wrought,
And now, being grey,
I dream that I have brought
To such a pitch my thought
That coming time can say,
,,He shadowed in a glass
What thing her body was.''

For she had fiery blood
When I was young,
And trod so sweetly proud
As 'twere upon a cloud,
A woman Homer sung,
That life and letters seem
But an heroic dream. 

I:yeats2002021493
T:Words
F:I had this thought a while ago

I had this thought a while ago,
,,My darling cannot understand
What I have done, or what would do
In this blind bitter land.''

And I grew weary of the sun
Until my thoughts cleared up again,
Remembering that the best I have done
Was done to make it plain;

That every year I have cried, ,,At length
My darling understands it all,
Because I have come into my strength,
And words obey my call;''

That had she done so who can say
What would have shaken from the sieve?
I might have thrown poor words away
And been content to live.

T:No Second Troy
F:Why should I blame her that she filled my days

Why should I blame her that she filled my days
With misery, or that she would of late
Have taught to ignorant men most violent ways,
Or hurled the little streets upon the great,
Had they but courage equal to desire?
What could have made her peaceful with a mind
That nobleness made simple as a fire,
With beauty like a tightened bow, a kind
That is not natural in an age like this,
Being high and solitary and most stern?
Why, what could she have done, being what she is?
Was there another Troy for her to burn?

I:yeats2002021495
T:Reconciliation
F:Some may have blamed you that you took away

Some may have blamed you that you took away
The verses that could move them on the day
When, the ears being deafened, the sight of the eyes blind
With lightning, you went from me, and I could find
Nothing to make a song about but kings,
Helmets, and swords, and half-forgotten things
That were like memories of you - but now
We'll out, for the world lives as long ago;
And while we're in our laughing, weeping fit,
Hurl helmets, crowns, and swords into the pit.
But, dear, cling close to me; since you were gone,
My barren thoughts have chilled me to the bone. 

I:yeats2002021496
T:King and no King
F:Would it were anything but merely voice!

,,Would it were anything but merely voice!''
The No King cried who after that was King,
Because he had not heard of anything
That balanced with a word is more than noise;
Yet Old Romance being kind, let him prevail
Somewhere or somehow that I have forgot,
Though he'd but cannon - Whereas we that had thought
To have lit upon as clean and sweet a tale
Have been defeated by that pledge you gave
In momentary anger long ago;
And I that have not your faith, how shall I know
That in the blinding light beyond the grave
We'll find so good a thing as that we have lost?
The hourly kindness, the day's common speech,
The habitual content of each with each
When neither soul nor body has been crossed.

T:Peace
F:Ah, that Time could touch a form

Ah, that Time could touch a form
That could show what Homer's age
Bred to be a hero's wage.
,,Were not all her life but storm,
Would not painters paint a form
Of such noble lines,'' I said,
,,Such a delicate high head,
All that sternness amid charm,
All that sweetness amid strength?''
Ah, but peace that comes at length,
Came when Time had touched her form. 

I:yeats2002021498
T:Against Unworthy Praise
F:O heart, be at peace, because

O heart, be at peace, because
Nor knave nor dolt can break
What's not for their applause,
Being for a woman's sake.
Enough if the work has seemed,
So did she your strength renew,
A dream that a lion had dreamed
Till the wilderness cried aloud,
A secret between you two,
Between the proud and the proud.

What, still you would have their praise!
But here's a haughtier text,
The labyrinth of her days
That her own strangeness perplexed;
And how what her dreaming gave
Earned slander, ingratitude,
From self-same dolt and knave;
Aye, and worse wrong than these.
Yet she, singing upon her road,
Half lion, half child, is at peace.

T:The Fascination of What's Difficult
F:The fascination of what's difficult

The fascination of what's difficult
Has dried the sap out of my veins, and rent
Spontaneous joy and natural content
Out of my heart. There's something ails our colt
That must, as if it had not holy blood
Nor on Olympus leaped from cloud to cloud,
Shiver under the lash, strain, sweat and jolt
As though it dragged road-metal. My curse on plays
That have to be set up in fifty ways,
On the day's war with every knave and dolt,
Theatre business, management of men.
I swear before the dawn comes round again
I'll find the stable and pull out the bolt. 

I:yeats20020216100
T:A Drinking Song
F:Wine comes in at the mouth

Wine comes in at the mouth
And love comes in at the eye;
That's all we shall know for truth
Before we grow old and die.
I lift the glass to my mouth,
I look at you, and I sigh.

I:yeats20020216101
T:The Coming of Wisdom with Time
F:Though leaves are many, the root is one

Though leaves are many, the root is one;
Through all the lying days of my youth
I swayed my leaves and flowers in the sun;
Now I may wither into the truth.

I:yeats20020216102
T:On hearing that the Students of our New University have joined the Agitation against Immoral Literature
F:Where, where but here have pride and Truth

Where, where but here have Pride and Truth,
That long to give themselves for wage,
To shake their wicked sides at youth
Restraining reckless middle-age? 

I:yeats20020216103
T:To a Poet, who would have me Praise certain Bad Poets, Imitators of His and Mine
F:You say, as I have often given tongue

You say, as I have often given tongue
In praise of what another's said or sung,
'Twere politic to do the like by these;
But was there ever dog that praised his fleas? 

I:yeats20020216104
T:The Mask
F:Put off that mask of burning gold

,,Put off that mask of burning gold
With emerald eyes.''
,,O no, my dear, you make so bold
To find if hearts be wild and wise,
And yet not cold.''

,,I would but find what's there to find,
Love or deceit.''
,,It was the mask engaged your mind,
And after set your heart to beat,
Not what's behind.''

,,But lest you are my enemy,
I must enquire.''
,,O no, my dear, let all that be;
What matter, so there is but fire
In you, in me?''

I:yeats20020216105
T:Upon a House shaken by the Land Agitation
F:How should the world be luckier if this house

How should the world be luckier if this house,
Where passion and precision have been one
Time out of mind, became too ruinous
To breed the lidless eye that loves the sun?
And the sweet laughing eagle thoughts that grow
Where wings have memory of wings, and all
That comes of the best knit to the best? Although
Mean roof-trees were the sturdier for its fall,
How should their luck run high enough to reach
The gifts that govern men, and after these
To gradual Time's last gift, a written speech
Wrought of high laughter, loveliness and ease? 

I:yeats20020216106
T:At the Abbey Theatre
U:(Imitated from Ronsard)
F:Dear Craoibhin Aoibhin, look into our case

Dear Craoibhin Aoibhin, look into our case.
When we are high and airy hundreds say
That if we hold that flight they'll leave the place,
While those same hundreds mock another day
Because we have made our art of common things,
So bitterly, you'd dream they longed to look
All their lives through into some drift of wings.
You've dandled them and fed them from the book
And know them to the bone; impart to us -
We'll keep the secret - a new trick to please.
Is there a bridle for this Proteus
That turns and changes like his draughty seas?
Or is there none, most popular of men,
But when they mock us, that we mock again? 

I:yeats20020216107
T:These are the Clouds
F:These are the clouds about the fallen sun

These are the clouds about the fallen sun,
The majesty that shuts his burning eye:
The weak lay hand on what the strong has done,
Till that be tumbled that was lifted high
And discord follow upon unison,
And all things at one common level lie.
And therefore, friend, if your great race were run
And these things came, so much the more thereby
Have you made greatness your companion,
Although it be for children that you sigh:
These are the clouds about the fallen sun,
The majesty that shuts his burning eye. 

I:yeats20020216108
T:At Galway Races
F:There where the course is

There where the course is,
Delight makes all of the one mind,
The riders upon the galloping horses,
The crowd that closes in behind:
We, too, had good attendance once,
Hearers and hearteners of the work;
Aye, horsemen for companions,
Before the merchant and the clerk
Breathed on the world with timid breath.
Sing on: somewhere at some new moon,
We'll learn that sleeping is not death,
Hearing the whole earth change its tune,
Its flesh being wild, and it again
Crying aloud as the racecourse is,
And we find hearteners among men
That ride upon horses. 

I:yeats20020216109
T:A Friend's Illness
F:Sickness brought me this

Sickness brought me this
Thought, in that scale of his:
Why should I be dismayed
Though flame had burned the whole
World, as it were a coal,
Now I have seen it weighed
Against a soul? 

I:yeats20020216110
T:All Things can tempt Me
F:All things can tempt me from this craft of verse

All things can tempt me from this craft of verse:
One time it was a woman's face, or worse -
The seeming needs of my fool-driven land;
Now nothing but comes readier to the hand
Than this accustomed toil. When I was young,
I had not given a penny for a song
Did not the poet sing it with such airs
That one believed he had a sword upstairs;
Yet would be now, could I but have my wish,
Colder and dumber and deafer than a fish. 

I:yeats20020216111
T:Brown Penny
F:I whispered, ,,I am too young,''

I whispered, ,,I am too young,''
And then, ,,I am old enough'';
Wherefore I threw a penny
To find out if I might love.
,,Go and love, go and love, young man,
If the lady be young and fair.''
Ah, penny, brown penny, brown penny,
I am looped in the loops of her hair.

And the penny sang up in my face,
,,There is nobody wise enough
To find out all that is in it,
For he would be thinking of love
That is looped in the loops of her hair,
Till the loops of time had run.''
Ah, penny, brown penny, brown penny.
One cannot begin it too soon.
